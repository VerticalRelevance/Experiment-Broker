# Chaos Toolkit Lite

This module provides a lightweight version of the Chaos Toolkit that can be used to run experiments without relying on Chaos Toolkit's libraries. This module is intended to be used in environments where the full Chaos Toolkit is not available or is not desired.

To import dynamically, the structure of this module is restricted to the import paths of chaostoolkit.
